# PRO2 - Subject
This is a C++ project using `classes`. Performed in a subject from the Engineering Degree. 
The class structure simulates a platform that evaluates code called `evaluator`.
We also deeply explored `data types` in order to use in each case the most optimal and efficient, such as binari trees  (all doned with recursion) or dictionaries.
